# NFL Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze NFL data, including game statistics, player performance, and weather conditions, to develop predictive models for various outcomes such as game results and player performance. The analysis combines structured data (such as NFL stats and weather data) with unstructured information (like stadium details) to enhance the predictive power.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## Features
- **NFL Stats Analysis**: Collect and analyze NFL statistics to predict outcomes.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Incorporates weather data to assess the impact of conditions on games.
- **Stadium Insights**: Unstructured data on stadiums is used to provide context for performance variations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models built using scikit-learn to predict game results and player performance.

## Setup Instructions
