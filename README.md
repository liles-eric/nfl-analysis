# NFL Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze NFL data, including game statistics, player performance, and weather conditions, to develop predictive models for various outcomes such as game results and player performance. The analysis combines structured data (such as NFL stats and weather data) with unstructured information (like stadium details) to enhance the predictive power.

## Project Structure

1. **data/**  
    1.1 **nfl-stats/** - NFL stats datasets (e.g., game stats, player stats).  
    1.2 **weather/** - Weather data associated with game locations.  
    1.3 **unstructured/** - Unstructured data (e.g., stadium info, key facts).  

2. **scripts/**  
    2.1 **Python scripts for data processing and analysis.**  

3. **docs/**  
    3.1 **Documentation folder for business processes and analysis.**  

4. **README.md**  
    4.1 **This project description file.**

5. **LICENSE**  
    5.1 **MIT License for the project.**

6. **.gitignore**  
    6.1 **Specifies files and directories Git should ignore.**

7. **requirements.txt**  
    7.1 **Python dependencies for the project.**

## Features

- **NFL Stats Analysis**: Collect and analyze NFL statistics to predict outcomes.
- **Weather Data Integration**: Incorporates weather data to assess the impact of conditions on games.
- **Stadium Insights**: Uses unstructured data on stadiums to provide context for performance variations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Builds machine learning models using scikit-learn to predict game results and player performance.
- **Data Pipelines**: Implements pipelines using Azure services for the automated transfer and storage of data, particularly weather and game stats.
